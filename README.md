Scripts behind the publication "An assessment of basal melt parameterisations for Antarctic ice shelves"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the scripts behind the publication: 

Burgard, C., Jourdain, N. C., Reese, R., Jenkins, A., and Mathiot, P.: An assessment of basal melt parameterisations for Antarctic ice shelves, The Cryosphere Discuss. [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-32, in review, 2022. 

I am currently putting some order in everything and working on a clear workflow. So bear with me, more explanation will be added soon!

If you want to play around with the parameterisations and your own data, have a look at the package multimelt: https://github.com/ClimateClara/multimelt
